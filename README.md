# Saving
Map state is automatically saved (`$XDG_CONFIG_DIR` or `~/.config` on Unix, and the `%APPDATA%` folder on Windows) while the app runs, and is loaded on map load.<br/>
You can also manually save/load state via the UI.

# AGP Output
Map state can be output in [AGP](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/agp/AGP_Specification/) format via the UI. Objects are first created according to the scaffolds defined in scaffolding mode, with remaining sequences output as singletons.<br/>
## AGP Correction
Note that object/part sizes will only be accurate up to the size of an individual map texel, and that any input sequences smaller than an individual texel will not be output.<br/>
AGP files can be corrected by the included python script [AGPCorrect](https://github.com/wtsi-hpag/PretextView/blob/master/AGPCorrect), which requires access to the input sequences in (gzipped) FASTA format.
```bash
AGPCorrect ref.fa(.gz) map.agp >corrected_scaffs.agp
```
The script requires
* Python >= 3.8
* [Biopython](https://biopython.org/)
